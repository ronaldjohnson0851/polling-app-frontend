**** Screenshot #2 This is the home page. The main page displays all polls in card format, showing questions and voting options. Users can view existing polls, cast votes using radio buttons, create new polls, or refresh the list. A status indicator at the bottom shows the connection to the Spring Boot backend and the number of loaded polls.
